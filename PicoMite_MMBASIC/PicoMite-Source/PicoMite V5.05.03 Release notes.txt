PicoMite V5.07.03 Changes from V5.07.01

When first loaded this version will force a complete flash wipe removing all options, saved variables, and any prorams stored in flash

General changes
PicoMiteVGA introduced - see manual for details
Program now runs from flash memory freeing up much more memory
Maximum program size now 124Kbytes (108 for VGA version
Flash slots reduced from 10 to 7 (8 for VGA version).
FLASH RUN and FLASH CHAIN now execute direct from the specified flash slot without changing the main program
Support for a PS2 Keyboard added
Significant performance tuning
Improved USB console receive
Increased the maximum display width in OPTION DISPLAY to 240 characters
Enables F1 as a user programmable function key
Implements support for SSD1963 parallel displays
Support for 240x240 round GC9A01 display
Reduces maximum file name length to 63 characters but increase maximum files that can be listed with FILES command to 1000
Increases drive level for SDcard output pins (CD, MOSI and CLOCK)
New font added FONT 8 is a very small 6x4 font useful for 320x240 screens
OPTION MEMORY removed as no longer relevant
OPTION BAUDRATE n now sets the baudrate for when a serial console is used
AUTOSAVE can now be terminated by entering Control-Z  or F1 which will then cause the received data to be transferred into program memory 
overwriting the previous program. Use F2 to exit and immediately run the program.
Reading from the framebuffer now available and bug fixed on SSD1963, ILI9341, ST7789_320 and ILI9488
This enables the following on these displays:
