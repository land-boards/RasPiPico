At the time of writing none of these particular boards have been produced or tested. There is consequently no guarantee whatsoever that this design will do what you want or even work at all. :) However, a prototype has been built, tested and is working very well indeed. The major difference from the prototype is in some mechanical engineering related to fitting the PCB into the case. When some new cases ber obtained it was discovered that, although appearing to be identical, they are not - and in ways that required some quite major changes.I *hope* that these boards will fit the new cases. I'm afraid there's no way to specify which type of case you'll get if you order one. It looks like there are at least two manufacturers and neither produces detailed drawings and part numbers.



Many thanks to Geoff Graham for his excellent MMBasic and to Peter Mather for his hard work in porting it (and widely extending it!) for the Raspberry Pi Pico to produce the PicoMite and then the PicoMite VGA Edition. Thanks also to Raspberry Pi, who I think have produced more than originally expected in the Pico. Thanks also to the folks on The Back Shed Forum, which is the spiritual home of everything to do with MMBasic.
