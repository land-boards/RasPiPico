Many thanks to Geoff Graham for his excellent MMBasic and to Peter Mather for his hard work in porting it (and widely extending it!) for the Raspberry Pi Pico to produce the PicoMite and then the PicoMite VGA Edition. Thanks also to Raspberry Pi, who I think have produced more than originally expected in the Pico. Thanks also to the folks on The Back Shed Forum, which is the spiritual home of everything to do with MMBasic.
